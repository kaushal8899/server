Kanyakumari, once part of the erstwhile princely realm of Travancore lies at the southernmost tip of the Indian peninsula. It is the southern tip of the majestic Cardamom Hills, a chain of hills along the west coast of India. It is also the confluence point of three oceans - the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Sea, and the Indian Ocean.Kanyakumari casts a magical spell of its own with its unparalleled natural splendor, rich culture and varied traditions. Once referred to as the Alexandria of the East, the place was a well known trading and commercial center, besides being a hub of arts and culture.The brilliance of the imposing sunrise and the soft sunset that dazzles over the confluence of three oceans, leaves one with exuberance. It is the only place in India where one can view both sunset and moonrise simultaneously on a full moon day.Every morning countless visitors flock to the beaches, awaiting the magnificent sight of daybreak to unfold. The brilliant picture of morning sky, garbed in glowing hues of pastel colors with the silhouette of fishing boats, as the sun rises above the horizon will remain forever engraved in ones memory. Sunsets offer an equally spectacular picture.This exquisite land offers a feast for the eyes from the rainbow beaches with multi colored sand, the spectacular azure ocean lashing the shore in passionate fury, ravishingly beautiful palm fringed beaches, the majestic hills to the emerald green paddy fields. Kanyakumari, being in the border of the two states, offers a blend of Kerala and Tamil Nadu traditions.
